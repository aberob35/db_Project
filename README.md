# db_Project
To run our project everything needs to be in the same directory where the public folder has all of its data and there is a server.js and the database.db not in the public folder. All we do is run server.js on a terminal that is already in the directory with the server.js and then you will need to look up http://localhost:3000 or just localhost:3000.
