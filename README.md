# db_Project
To run our project everything needs to be in the same directory where the public folder has all of its data and all of the other files except for inserstats are there as well as including the unzipped nodeModules. NodeModules needs to be unzipped and then put in the same directory as everything else. To run it all we do is run server.js on a terminal that is already in the directory with the server.js and everything and then you will need to look up http://localhost:3000 or just localhost:3000. 

InsertStat folder is just the code used to make the sql statements in case you wanted to see it.
